## Please stop messaging me asking me how to compile this. Some of the dependencies are private and I only released this so people could see the core cheat logic.
A Cheat for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare written in Rust using my memlib-rs library

I have stopped working on this project. This was made mostly for fun and to learn Rust.
If you're building your own cheat, you can probably find some good resources in here such 
as the math for aimbot or ESP. If you end up using this project and update the offsets and encryption,
feel free to create a pull request.
